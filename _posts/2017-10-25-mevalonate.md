<!--Upper mevalonate pathway of eukaryotes, archaea, and eubacteria all begin the same way. The sole carbon feed stock of the pathway is acetyl-CoA. The first step condenses two acetyl-CoA molecules to yield acetoacetyl-CoA. This is followed by a second condensation to form HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl-CoA). Reduction of HMG-CoA yields (R)-mevalonate. These first 3 enzymatic steps are called the upper mevalonate pathway [1,2]. The mevalonate production is regulated by HGMCR. The cartoon is redrawn from Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [3]. HGMCR becomes inactive by phosphorylation through AMPK heterotrimer [4,5,6]. HGMCR becomes active by dephosphorylation through the catalyst PP2A [7]. The phosphorylation of the AMPK heterotrimer is regulated by LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex or by CaMMKK [8].  The phosphorylated AMPK binds AMP. The cartoon is redrawn from Activated AMPK stimulates fatty-acid oxidation in muscle [9].-->
