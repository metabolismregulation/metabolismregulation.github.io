## Description

The ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) catalyses the transformation of citrate, which is an intermediary product of the metabolism of carbohydrates, into acetyl-CoA. This latter plays a major role in the fatty acids synthesis pathways, but also in gene expression, through the acetylation of histones. Hence, ACLY (i) serves as a bridge between the carbohydrates and the fatty acids metabolisms, and (ii) is a key player in the regulation of gene expression, in particular the one mediated by glucose availability.
